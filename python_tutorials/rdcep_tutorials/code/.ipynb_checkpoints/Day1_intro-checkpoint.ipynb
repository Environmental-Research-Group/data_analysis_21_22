    "Students: If you want to learn and master this material more quickly, it is recommended that you open a blank Jupyter notebook, open the Jupyter notebook for the dayâ€™s lesson in another window, and type out the code yourself while following along with the lesson. This will help you practice running the code and you will gain familiarity with the notation. You can also use the pdf version of the notebook, but there may be some cells that look different than they do in Jupyter Notebooks.\n",

The list of functions does not have every function covered in each day, it is meant to be a summary of the most important functions. There is an additional, comprehensive list of functions covered in each day located...\n",

    "As you go through the lessons, there will be periodic 'check-ins' so you can measure your progress. It is recommended that you first try to answer the check-in question on your own without looking at the answer, and \n",
