# Perrin's Subdirectory
## Purpose
This is my (Perrin's) subdirectory within the ERG's Data Analysis working group GitHub for 2021-2022. This is where all of my work is going to be done and stored. It is important to note that this work is just the code -- we are not using this service like a Google Drive. So, we want the source to be in these subdirectories, but not massive data files. We will be using a storage system like Drive to do this. 

## About me
I'm a Fourth Year at UChicago studying Physics, Applied Mathematics, and Statistics. My research is concerned with developing computational models of the ocean, with a particular interest in how physical systems impact chemical and biological ones.

## Contact
You can contact me at <pwd@uchicago.edu>. I am always interested in talking about research, bluegrass, lacrosse, or skiing!
